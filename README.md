# WindowsUniversalTestHook
A test hook implementation for a Windows Universal application.

## Synopsis

This project shows how you can create a test hook system for your Windows Universal app. A test hook system allows you to insert variables into your application and provides an in-application UI for you to toggle and change these variables.

## Motivation

The purpose for test hooks allows a developer to quick get into a state so they can debug or iterate on a feature. This helps save valuable developer time when trying to get into a state that takes a long time and speeds up iteration time.
